    <p>I made this because at some point I will lose access to my school account and will no longer be able to update
        the list of characters on the Roleplay website.</p>
    <p>Since everyone in the world technically has access to this site (I can&rsquo;t just add some sort of login
        system), instead of using your names, I will just use the prefixes from Flintface&rsquo;s warrior names that she
        gave us.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m not very good at this HTML and CSS thing, so this site is going to remain looking like this for the
        forseeable future.</p>
