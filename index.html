    <p>I made this because at some point I will lose access to my school account and will no longer be able to update the list of characters on the Roleplay website.</p>
    <p>Since everyone in the world technically has access to this site (I can&rsquo;t just add some sort of login system), instead of using your names, I will just use the prefixes from Flintface&rsquo;s warrior names that she gave us.</p>
